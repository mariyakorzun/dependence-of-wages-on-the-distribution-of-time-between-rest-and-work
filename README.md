# dependence-of-wages-on-the-distribution-of-time-between-rest-and-work

We use data which contains information about time when person relax (sleep, sleep & naps, relax all), time spent working in the market (first job, second job, total) and different economic variables.
Time is scarce; and we always have to choose between work and rest. In section I we establish the existence of a relationship between rest time and time spent working in the market and other socio-demographic and labor variables. In section II we try to understand how timing affects wage.
